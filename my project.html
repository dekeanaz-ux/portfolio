      The SMS Notification Automated Poultry Feeder is an automatic feeding and watering 
      device for poultry. The project's main objective is to significantly reduce human labor 
      requirements within the poultry structure. This will create fewer disturbances to the chicken and 
      reduce the causes of bacteria inversion as humans are the main carrier of bacteria to the poultry 
      area. This project develops a prototype to convey the remaining feed weight to the user with 
      SMS notifications, allowing the user to specify the time to feed the poultry. In addition, it 
      develops a prototype to automate the watering system and feedings.
      The user will handle poultry more quickly and efficiently in this project. It is made up of 
      automated equipment such as Arduino Uno microcontroller, which will be interfaced with 
      sensors such as Load cell, GSM module, Liquid Crystal Display, DHT11 temperature and 
      humidity sensor, Keypad and servo motor. The DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor will 
      measure the temperature and humidity of the structure and fluctuations dealt with manually.
      Automated SMS poultry feeder is more efficient than the poultry feeding manual 
      technique. The project thereby reduces the time for feeding the poultry and increases the 
      production of the poultry. <a style="color: red;" href="/ombui.html/Final Project Report.pdf">

    POWER LOAD SHADING

<div class="chicken-project">
  
  <div class="chicken-abstract">
    With the increased consumption of electrical energy in our country, there is a need to develop a 
    system that will help in load shedding during peak hours to avoid losing the entire power system. 
    Load shedding is the process through which Power transmission and distribution companies 
    reduce electrical energy consumption by customers due to power shortage or overloading of the 
    transmission and distribution lines, causing the entire system to be at risk. The peak hours of 
    electricity consumption may vary for different places such as manufacturing industries, 
    households and learning institutions. The current system available is the Power System Load 
    shedding system at the National Control Centre managed by the Kenya Power & Lighting 
    Company. Therefore, there is a need to design a load shedding system customised for a given 
    place. In this project, a load shedding system will be designed for Kenyatta University that will 
    help in monitoring the electrical load at different times of the day. In a scenario where the 
    demand is greater than the supply, there would be a need to shed off some of the load not to lose 
    the entire power supply system. This process ensures that the heavy loads are shed off during 
    peak hours, and the necessary loads are retained. The project simulation will be done using 
    proteus software using the current sensors and a microcontroller. This project will help in 
    reducing power outages by proper regulation of the load and ensure proper utilisation of 
    electrical energy. <a style="color: red;" href="/ombui.html/load shading.pdf">
